# Atmospheric_General_Circulation

Notebook 1 : Plot the zonal mean radiative budget from CERES data. Derive an analytic approximation of the radiative budget to highlight the radiative differential heating. COmpute the required heat transport by the global circulation to compensate radiative differential heating.

Notebook 2 : Compute the Hadley Meridional Overturning Circulation from NCEP monthly reanalysis data

Notebook 3 : illustrate the difference between a zonal anomaly and a transient anomaly. Demonstrate the decomposition
$$z' = z-\overline{z}$$
$$z^* = z-[z]$$

$$z=\overline{[z]}+\overline{z^*}+[z]'+z^{*'}$$

Note 1 : This code was developed for educationnal purposes, and for French students. So the comments in the notebook are in French but the graphics and legends are in English.

Note 2 : If you have any comment/suggestion, if you find this code useful --> please send me an email : mailto:frederic.ferry@meteo.fr

The gridded data needed to run the notebook are NOT provided. Get it here :
